BC breakage issues:

This is a list of known issues that could
break backwards compatibility with patTemplate
versions below 3.0.0

- patTemplate::dump()
  This method now accepts two parameters:
  dump( [array templates [, string dumper]] )
  As long as you called it without parameters there will be no
  problems

- whitespace treatment has changed (no rtrim, ltrim possible anymore)
  When a patTemplate tag is encountered, _only_ the tag is removed but
  all surrounding whitespace is left the way it has been found on the
  template, as long as you do not set the whitespace attribute.

- new error handling instead of die()

- deprecated methods have been removed
  addTemplate(), addTemplates(),

- adding the same variable twice may cause problems, if it's scalar
  the first time and an array the second time (or the other way round)
  (will be fixed)
  
- condition="empty" and condition="default" should now be used as
  condition="__empty" and condition"__default"
  (old values will be allowed until 3.1.0)
  
- placeholder="none"  should now be used as
  placeholder="__none"
  (old value will be allowed until 3.1.0)
